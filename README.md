# Chain-Reaction-Game
A strategy game for people who like to try out new games The objective of Chain
Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.
Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell. Once a cell has reached critical
mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming
the cell for the player. A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that
contains orbs of their own color. As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are
out of the game.
